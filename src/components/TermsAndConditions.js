            responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or other damage
            resulting from limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in

            communications. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Service is

            purpose or non-infringement. Meyi takes reasonable care for virus
            protection and other harmful components; however, given the nature
            of virus evolution, Meyi makes no warranty that the service will be

            that: the service will be error-free or uninterrupted (including,

            interruptions occur, Meyi will take reasonable efforts the rectify
            the errors and interruptions; any information or advice obtained by
            the Customer in connection with the usage of the Service for the
            fitment of its internal business purpose will be accurate or

            to provide the most relevant information to the customer but Meyi
            would not be able to guarantee its accuracy or fitment for the
            purpose; that should be decided by the customer by taking into
            account other factors that Meyi might not be privy to, the results
            of using the Service will meet Customer requirements.
